"""
adaptor — the pure half of the custom-adaptor loop (`ascend adaptor ...`).

A custom ADAPTOR is one JavaScript file that teaches the Ascend engine how to hold a conversation
with a target whose auth or session cannot be written as a request/response template: a login, a
token mint, a conversation that has to be opened first, a reply you have to poll for. It runs on
the Straiker side, in an isolate the engine destroys after every turn, and it is stored on the
application as `request_template._adaptor_src` (minified, base64).

It is NOT an adapter in this CLI's sense. A CLI adapter (runtime/adapters/) runs on YOUR side,
behind the bridge, and the platform never sees its code. The two solve the same problem from
opposite ends of the wire, which is why they are spelled differently on purpose:

    adapter   your side, Python, behind the bridge        ascend target add / adapter build
    adaptor   the engine's side, JavaScript, on the app   ascend adaptor gate / test / store

docs/CUSTOM_ADAPTOR.md says which one to reach for.

Nothing in here touches the network or the terminal. The HTTP calls live in control/api.py and the
command bodies in shells/cli/ascend.py, so every rule below is testable on its own: which template
keys survive a store, what the reply shape has to be, and whether a scored reply is the answer or
the whole body stringified.
