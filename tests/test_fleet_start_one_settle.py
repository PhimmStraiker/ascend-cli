"""A fleet start costs ONE settle window, not one per app or one per wave of workers.

Measured 2026-11-10: `assess run` with 13 apps ran 8 workers, and each worker blocked in its own
45 s `confirm_started` window after its submission, so the call made two waves and took ~98 s
before it returned. The fleet now SUBMITS every app together (up to FLEET_START_WORKERS at once)
and CONFIRMS them all inside one shared window (`AscendAPI.confirm_started_many`).

These run the real `assess run` command and the real settle loop against a fake platform: no
sockets, no processes, a short settle window and a small per-request latency.
